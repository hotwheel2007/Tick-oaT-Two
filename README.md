# Tick-oaT-Two
Tick-oat-two, a tic-tac-toe variation created by Oats Jenkins made in python!

Note: This is a text-based version of tick-oat-two, so don't expect a fancy UI!

HOW TO PLAY:
Player 1 will place horizontal lines ("â€“") and player 2 will place vertical lines ("|"). If two players place their pieces on the same spot, that spot becomes a plus sign ("+"). The goal is to get three plus signs in a row. Whichever player completes the line wins.

To make a move, simply type the row that you would like to place on followed by the collumn you want to place on. For example, I wanted to place in the middle I would type "b2", because row b is the middle row, and collumn 2 is the middle collumn.

DEPENDENCIES
- Python 3, any version should do, this project was made using python 3.10 however.
- Termcolor (Type "pip install termcolor" or "pip3 install termcolor" in your terminal of choice once python is installed)

To run the game, simply open the file with python. I recommend doing this from the command like, by navigating to the location of the Tick-oaT-Two.py file and running "python3 Tick-oaT-Two.py" or "python Tick-oaT-Two.py".
